### Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.

Backups are an important part of DevOps Engineers day to Day activities Lets understand How a DevOps Engineer takes backups of their work.

let's create a directory `mkdir scripts` and inside that we have created many shell scripts, text file etc.

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-170:~/scripts$ ls
chmod.sh  createDirectory.sh  file1.txt  forloop.sh  index.html  install_nginx_and_serve_webpage.sh useradd.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-170:~/scripts$ 
```

Now we want to take backup of directory 'scripts'.

lets create a file "`nano take-backup.sh`" and write shell script to take backup.

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

src=/home/ubuntu/scripts/
tgt=/home/ubuntu/backups/

filename=$(date +'%d-%m-%Y-%H-%M-%S').tar.gz

echo "Backup started for $filename"

tar -cvf $tgt/$filename $src

echo "Backup completed"
```

**"src"** variable contains the path(source) of your scripts directory that you want to take backup.

**"tgt"** contains the path of the target folder(backups) where you want to store you backup.

**"filename=$(date +'%d-%m-%Y-%H-%M-%S').tar.gz"** It creates a variable named `filename` and assigns it a value. The value is a string representing the current date and time in the format `dd-mm-yyyy-hh-mm-ss`, followed by the file extension `.tar.gz`.

* `tar`: The `tar` command is used to create, view, and manipulate tar archives.
    
* `-c`: This option specifies that you want to create a new archive.
    
* `-v`: The "verbose" option tells `tar` to display the progress and details of the archiving process. It shows the names of files as they are being added to the archive.
    
* `-f`: This option is used to specify the name of the archive file that `tar` will create. The filename is provided after this option.
    
* `$tgt/$filename`: This represents the target directory and the name of the tar archive file.
    
    when you run this script, your data will be successfully backed up.

    As we can see our data is successfully backed up and a zip file "`07-08-2023-11-24-22.tar.gz` " is created with current date and time inside **backups** folder and when you open the zip file using `cat 07-08-2023-11-24-22.tar.gz` you can see all your backed up data.
    

### Cron & Crontab

"Cron" is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to schedule and automate the execution of commands or scripts at specific intervals or at particular times. Cron is commonly used for automating repetitive tasks, system maintenance, and scheduled backups.

To work with cron, you need to use the `crontab` command, which is used to create, edit, and manage the cron job schedules. Each user on the system can have their own set of cron jobs.

1. **To create crontab file type following command:**
    
    ```plaintext
    crontab -e
    ```
    
    Above command will open a by default nano terminal editor with a new blank crontab file, or it will open an existing crontab if you already have one.

2. **To see the list of active crontab entries the command is:**
    
    ```plaintext
    crontab -l
    ```
    

### Crontab syntax

A crontab file has six fields for specifying minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week and the command to be run at that interval. See below:

```plaintext
*     *     *     *     *  command to be executed
-     -     -     -     -
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     +----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
|     |     |     +------- month (1 - 12)
|     |     +--------- day of month (1 - 31)
|     +----------- hour (0 - 23)
+------------- min (0 - 59)
```

### **Crontab Examples**

Writing a crontab file can be a somewhat confusing for first time users, therefore I have listed below some crontab examples:

```plaintext
* * * * *  #Runs every minute
30 * * * *  #Runs at 30 minutes past the hour
45 6 * * *  #Runs at 6:45 am every day
45 18 * * *  #Runs at 6:45 pm every day
00 1 * * 0  #Runs at 1:00 am every Sunday
00 1 * * 7  #Runs at 1:00 am every Sunday
00 1 * * Sun  #Runs at 1:00 am every Sunday
30 8 1 * *  #Runs at 8:30 am on the first day of every month
00 0-23/2 02 07 *  #Runs every other hour on the 2nd of July
```

As well as the above there are also special strings that can be used:

```plaintext
@reboot  #Runs at boot
@yearly  #Runs once a year [0 0 1 1 *]
@annually  #Runs once a year [0 0 1 1 *]
@monthly  #Runs once a month [0 0 1 * *]
@weekly  #Runs once a week [0 0 * * 0]
@daily  #Runs once a day [0 0 * * *]
@midnight  #Runs once a day [0 0 * * *]
@hourly  #Runs once an hour [0 * * * *]
```

To remove the crontab file enter the following command:

```plaintext
crontab -r
```

### Automate the backup Script using Crontab

let's create a cronjob which will automatically runs `take-backup.sh` file to take the backup of our "scripts" folder.

```plaintext
* * * * * bash /home/ubuntu/scripts/take-backup.sh
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691411004023/21903c67-4d04-4f41-a51c-1bef1fd79bb0.png align="center")

above cronjob will take backup of "scripts" folder every minute.

Enter the command `watch -n 2 ls` , The `watch` command is used to repeatedly execute a given command at a regular interval and display the output in the terminal. In the case of `watch -n 2 ls`, the command will run the `ls` command every 2 seconds and display the directory listing in the terminal.

you will see your files are getting backed up every minute.
